    Flags must have the same name like the first position of each link

    IPTV-List-Updater/list/. The size of the flags must be 270x200 pixels 
    and must be saved in PNG format. 	

7. Can I hide individual streaming lists?
    You must modify in folder /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/
    IPTV-List-Updater/list (depending on the GUI language for example
    de.txt for German) with Notepad++ and delete all the lines which you 
    do not want to use. Do not forget to save the file.

8. How can I integrate and convert own m3u files ?
    This requires an m3u file that is loaded on Dropbox for example.
    Then modify in folder /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/Extensions/
    IPTV-List-Updater/list language file (depending on the GUI language, 
    fro example de.txt for German ) with Notepad++ and add a new row .
    The four entries must be expressed as :
    
    Flagname Bouquettype Downloadpath Bouquetname B ( for bouquet
    file download )
    
    - Flag Name = select an existing flag name or create a new one
      (as Number 6 describes its own flag)
    
    - Bouquettype = There are 3 types of Bouquet (TV, RADIO or WEBCAM)
    
    - Downloadpath = Link to m3u file on your server or Dropbox 
      you have to copy the link in the "Download-Button" and paste it 
      as a downloadpath in the language file, and not the link to the 
      m3u file.
    
    - Bouquetname = here you can enter the Bouquetname how it will 
      appear in the plugin and in the TV Bouquet of installation.
      
    - B = Here you can enter a B, then the file is only downloaded and
      stored in your system.
    
    Now, you must only call up the plugin and let run the installation
    for your bouquet.

9. What is the iptvlistupdater.user file ?
    The file is to ensure that you can save your own download sources.
    This will not be overwritten by update. The file is also stored in 
    the settings backup and you can restore it after flashing firmware new !
    
    Where this file must be saved ?
     in == > / etc/enigma2
